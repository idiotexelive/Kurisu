SD card corruption is most commonly caused by cheap SD cards or USB converters from unknown brands.

To prevent corruption, it's recommended you buy SD cards from reputable brands, such as Sandisk, Samsung, Kingston, ect.

Furthermore, it's recommended you use a laptop, computer or smartphone with a dedicated SD card port instead of relying on USB converters. But if you *absolutely* need a USB converter, you can use either a UGreen or Anker branded one.

If none of these apply to you, the corruption could've been caused by unplugging the SD card before properly ejecting it inside of the OS.
